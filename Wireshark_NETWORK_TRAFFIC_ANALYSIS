•  Average Rate: ~3,490 packets/second

Top Communication Patterns

Primary Source Device: 192.168.1.117 (local device - likely your machine)

Major Traffic Flows:
1. 103.25.152.63: 185,337 packets (198 MB) - Highest volume traffic
2. 202.12.82.10: 13,035 packets (14 MB) 
3. 148.113.2.148: 5,680 packets (6 MB)
4. 148.113.1.222: 1,815 packets (1.5 MB)

Protocol Distribution
•  TCP: 207,279 packets (221 MB) - 98% of traffic
•  TLS/HTTPS: 117,499 packets (170 MB) - Dominant encrypted traffic
•  HTTP: Only 6 packets (minimal unencrypted web traffic)

Key Services and Domains Identified

DNS Queries Revealed:
•  Google services: clients.l.google.com, encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com
•  Apple services: smoot-api-safari-aaps1b.v.aaplimg.com, gateway.icloud.com
•  Advertising: www.googleadservices.com, pagead2.googlesyndication.com
•  Network testing: ping-test.net

TLS Connections (SNI Analysis):

•  Google services: clients1.google.com
•  Apple APIs: api-safari-aaps1b.smoot.apple.com
•  Google Images: encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com
•  Network infrastructure: Multiple .fireinfra.net domains

Security Observations

Positive Security Indicators:
•  98%+ of web traffic is encrypted (TLS/HTTPS)
•  Only 3 HTTP requests found (to certificate repository)
•  Strong preference for encrypted protocols

Notable Patterns:
•  Heavy use of CDN and cloud services
•  Significant Apple ecosystem traffic (iCloud, Safari services)
•  Google advertising and analytics traffic
•  Some network testing/probing activity

Network Behavior Analysis
•  This appears to be normal web browsing and application activity
•  Mix of streaming/download (large data volumes) and interactive traffic
•  Active use of Apple services and Google ecosystem
•  No obvious signs of malicious activity
•  Standard residential network patterns with local router (192.168.1.254)

The capture shows typical modern internet usage with heavy emphasis on encrypted communications, cloud services, and content delivery networks.
