**Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

**Objective:**
The aim of this task is to learn how to spot potentially harmful browser extensions and remove them in order to improve both security and browser performance.

---

### Step 1: Opening Extensions Manager

* I opened the **Extensions/Add-ons Manager** in my browser (Google Chrome).
* This section lists all installed extensions with their permissions.

---

### Step 2: Reviewing Installed Extensions

* I carefully reviewed the list of installed extensions.
* I checked:

  1. Extension names and developers.
  2. Permissions requested (like access to all websites, browsing history, etc.).
  3. User reviews and ratings online (if available).
  4. Whether I actually use the extension or if it was installed without my knowledge.

### Step 3: Identifying Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions

* **Example of Suspicious Extension:**

  * An extension I didn’t remember installing that requested permission to read browsing history.
* **Example of Unnecessary Extension:**

  * An old extension I no longer use for file downloads.

---

### Step 4: Removal Process

* I clicked **Remove/Delete** on the identified extensions.
* Restarted the browser to confirm they were removed successfully.

---

### Step 5: Observations After Removal

* Browser startup felt faster.
* Less clutter in the toolbar.
* Reduced risk of background data tracking by unwanted extensions.

---

### Step 6: Research – Risks of Malicious Extensions

* **Data Theft:** Extensions with high permissions can steal browsing data, passwords, or cookies.
* **Ad Injection:** Malicious add-ons can insert ads or redirect traffic to unsafe websites.
* **Spyware/Malware:** Some extensions secretly collect user behavior and send it to attackers.
* **System Performance Issues:** Unnecessary background processes may slow down browsing.

### Step 7: Summary

By reviewing and removing suspicious browser extensions, I improved both browser performance and security. Malicious extensions can cause serious harm by stealing data or slowing down the system. Regularly checking installed extensions is an important security practice.

**Final Takeaway:**
Only keep extensions that are trusted, necessary, and from official sources. Avoid granting unnecessary permissions, and review installed add-ons regularly.
