**Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength**

**Objective:**
The goal of this task is to understand the factors that make a password strong and to practically test different passwords using an online password strength checker. By doing so, we can learn how complexity, length, and character variety affect password security.

### Step 1: Password Creation

I created the following sample passwords with varying complexity:

1. **Password1**
2. **hello123**
3. **H3llo@2025**
4. **$ecureP@ss!98**
5. **Xy!7rK$1oPqWzL#2025**

### Step 2: Testing with Password Strength Checker

Tool used: [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)

**Results:**

1. **Password1**

* Score: 26%
* Feedback: Too short, predictable pattern, common word used.

2. **hello123**

* Score: 34%
* Feedback: Contains only lowercase letters and numbers; easy to guess; dictionary word detected.

3. **H3llo@2025**

* Score: 64%
* Feedback: Good mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and a symbol; length could be longer.

4. **$ecureP@ss!98**

* Score: 82%
* Feedback: Strong password; includes varied characters; length is decent.

5. **Xy!7rK$1oPqWzL#2025**

* Score: 100%
* Feedback: Very strong password; long length, includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and multiple symbols; not a dictionary word.

### Step 3: Best Practices Learned

From the evaluation, I learned that:

1. Longer passwords are much harder to crack.
2. Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes passwords stronger.
3. Avoid dictionary words, names, or simple patterns like “123” or “abcd.”
4. Randomness increases security; predictable replacements (like “P@ssw0rd”) are still weak.
5. Passwords should ideally be at least 12–16 characters.

### Step 4: Common Password Attacks (Research)

* **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found. The longer and more complex the password, the harder it is to crack.
* **Dictionary Attack:** Uses lists of common words and variations. If a password contains simple words (like “hello” or “password”), it is vulnerable.
* **Phishing / Social Engineering:** Instead of guessing, attackers trick users into revealing passwords.

### Step 5: Summary

This exercise showed how password complexity directly impacts security. A simple password like “Password1” is weak and can be cracked easily, while a long and random password like “Xy!7rK$1oPqWzL#2025” provides strong protection against brute force and dictionary attacks.

**Final Takeaway:**
A strong password should be long, random, and include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Using passphrases or password managers can also help maintain strong, unique passwords for each account.
